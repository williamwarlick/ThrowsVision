Before you Begin 
Throught my research, I ran into a variety of roadblocks unknowleing. If you don't get these thigns right from the beggining.
you can run into a lot of problems later and remains unsure of the solution.
1. Ensure use of a quality calibration frame.
   2. Calibration is a very particular matter that I overlooked for the majority of my project.
   3. I initally used a piece of 6X4 chessboard on printer paper. I belived that it was scaled properly and made measurmetns to confirm this.
